  New City 새로운도시</a></h2>
<STRONG> PART1 </<strong>
<p>I’ve recently moved to a new city for a new job.
This city is bigger than the one I used to live in.
Moving was stressful, but my new life here is quite comfortable now.
I had worried about finding a reasonably-priced place to
live because the rent had gone up so much in recent month.</p>
<p>But I managed to find a nice flat in a good location.
It only takes me 20 minutes to get to the office by bus.
And there is a nice park just 5 minutes’ walk from my house.
I often go to the park in the evening and walk for about 30 minutes.
I always listen to music while I walk.</p>
<p>There is also a big supermarket just around the corner.
It’s a very convenient location.
The only downside is that I don’t know anybody in this city.
I have no friends here.
I have tried to make friends at work, but I’m finding it quite hard.
I don’t know what the problem is.
I had several good friends at my old company.
I was able to make friends very easily then.
But at this new company, somehow it’s difficult to have a friendly
personal conversation.
We only talk about work.
Sometimes I miss my old job.
My old job was a bit boring, but I looked forward to my day
because I knew I was going to
meet friends at work.
My new job is much more interesting and better paid,
but I feel like my colleagues have
walls around them.
And I can’t get through those walls.
Sometimes I feel quite lonely at work.
Actually, I also feel lonely after work.
Because of the current situation, we are not supposed to be
meeting people after work.
We are supposed to go home and stay safe.
Under normal circumstances, there are many ways to meet new friends.
In most bigger cities you can usually find some hobby-related
groups on Naver or Daum
Cafe and it’s easy to meet new people there.
But nowadays all in-person meetups are cancelled.
It’s strange - this is a big city full of people, but I feel so alone.
Some days I feel quite depressed.
The whole world looks grey and I feel like everything is meaningless.
Often, I can’t concentrate at work.
Some days it’s hard to fall asleep at night.
I no longer have the energy to exercise.

May be I should go back to my old city this weekend and spend some time with
my frends.
