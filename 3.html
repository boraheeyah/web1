  First day with a neww boss 새 상사와의 첫날</a></h2>
<STRONG> PART1 </<strong>
  After several months of searching, I finally found a job.
  It was my first real research job, so I was quite excited.
  I had to move back to Seoul.
  I wasn’t happy about that:
  I don’t like cities.
  But what can you do?
  So, I moved to Seoul and the next day was my first day at work.
I was supposed to meet my new boss at a subway station at 9 am.
The next morning, I got to the station and waited and waited...
But the boss didn’t come.
It was early February, and it was snowing.
Big snowflakes were slowly falling onto the pavement.
The snow was beautiful, but it was so cold.
I called the boss but there was no answer.
There was a convenience store next to the station, so I went inside to wait.
40 minutes later, my boss called saying he had had a meeting.
Well, I didn’t know what to say.
A few minutes later he came, and he took me into the company building.
I was assigned a desk and was introduced to everybody.
Then we went into the boss’s office to talk over some details.
He switched on his computer, but the internet connection wasn’t working.
He couldn’t figure out what the problem was.
I tried to help.
I found that his LAN cable had come out of its socket, so I fixed it.
The boss said,
“Well, that took you ages.
It seems like you are no good at real life.
Let’s hope you’re better at research.”
I was surprised.
I had fixed his computer problem for him, so why was he insulting me?
But I didn’t say anything.
It’s important to be careful when speaking with the boss.
Later that day, I noticed that other people
in the office were also a bit scared of the boss.
To be continued..
