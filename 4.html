<STRONG> Monday: </<strong>
  I hate summers.
  It’s too hot for exercise.
  It’s too hot to even leave the house.
  Nowadays, I work from home.
  I don’t have to commute to work.
  But that also means that I get no exercise at all.
  The only exercise I do is walk from my desk to the kitchen and back.
That’s only about 200 steps a day.
I feel really tired and sluggish these days.
I can’t concentrate well.
And I don’t sleep well.
Some days it takes me almost 2 hours to fall asleep.
I think I need some exercise.
But the gyms are closed so I can’t go to the gym.
And it’s too hot outside so I can’t exercise outdoors.
Maybe I should buy a stationary bike!
I could even watch movies on my iPad while riding it.
I have wanted to buy a bike for a long time.
But I’ve been waiting for them to go on sale.
I wanted to buy it for a discounted price, but I don’t think I can wait anymore.
<strong>Tuesday:</strong>
I had a look at the online stores, but stationary bikes are so expensive!
They had some very nice stationary bikes on display at E-mart the other day.
But they were also too pricey for me.
So I’ve decided to search online for a second-hand bike.
I hope I can find one for a reasonable price.
There should be some online apps for buying second-hand.
Maybe I’ll start there.
<strong>Friday:</strong>
I’ve found a second-hand bike on one of the apps!
I’m going to pick it up after work today.
It’s really hard to find a bike nowadays.
That’s probably because gyms are closed.
The demand has gone up so much because people are looking for a way to exercise inside
their homes.
But I have finally found one!
And it was quite cheap.
<strong>Saturday:</strong>
Yesterday I brought the bike home.
I had to go all the way to the other side of the city to pick it up.
Then I had to drag it home by subway.
It was so heavy.
When I got home, I started assembling the bike.
It looked a little odd.
It had pedals but no seat.
Strange... How can I ride on it when it has no seat?
I found the manual and read the instructions.
Then I realized that this is not a bike!
I mean, it is called a “gym bike” but it’s not for cycling.
It’s for running.
That’s so confusing.
I tried running on it, but it is really difficult!
It’s much harder than actual running.
I can only run for 30 seconds before I get totally exhausted.
What should I do?
<strong>Sunday:</strong>
I have thought about the problem and I think I have the solution!
I pushed the bike all the way to the wall.
Then I took a chair and put it behind the bike.
I sat on the chair and used the pedals on the bike.
It worked!
The only downside is that the chair slowly moves backwards as I pedal.
I have to move the chair back into place every 5 minutes.
But other than that, so far so good!
