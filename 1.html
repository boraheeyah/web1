  Lost Love 잃어버린 사랑</a></h2>
<STRONG> PART1 </<strong>
<p>A few years ago, I lived in a gosiwon.
Onde day I met a new person in the kitchen.
<br>He told me his name was Luca, he was from Denmark and he had just arrived in Korea day.
<br>He'd never been to Korea before.
I asked him why he came.
<br>He said.
I lived in New York for 5 years.
Two years ago, I met a Korean girl.
<br>She had come to the US to work for a year.
<br>We started going out.
After dating for 5 months, she moved in with me.
<br>We were happy. I really loved her.</p>
<p>I haven't told her I'm coming.
I want to wurprise her and propose to her today.
<br>If she says yes, we can get married here in Korea.
I brought aall the neccessary papers for a marriage with me from Denmark.
Luca seemed really in love with the girl.

<br>He was a fun guy. He had travelled all around the world and had many interesting stories.
<p>We ate supper, talked a little and then went back to our rooms.</p>
<p>The next evening, I met Luca in the hall and he looked terrible - very down and depressed.
<br>"What's Wrong?" I asked.
"I met with Minji," he said. "she has a boyfriend.
<br>She said she really likes me but she can't leave him."
<br>"I'm really sorry about that What are you going to do now?" I asked.</p>
